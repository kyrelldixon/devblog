# Dev Blog [In Development]

This site is currently called Dev Blog while I think of an actual name for it. This is where I'll keep all of my code related content since I would like to keep it under a separate brand.

## TODOs

- [ ] Change the logo
- [ ] Come up with a site name
- [ ] Change the headline
- [ ] Add mailchimp (or alternative email platform)
- [ ] Add comment system
